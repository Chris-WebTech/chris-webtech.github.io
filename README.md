## About the Project

There are four pages to showcasing my abilities to organize the work I've completed over the past 2 years: Home, About Me, Languages, and a Resume page.
The Home page serves as a representation of my abilities to target and manipulate the design of HTML elements using CSS techniques; as-well-as, a basic summery and navigation for my GitHub. 
The About me Page indroduces a litle more about myselfâ€”the Developer. In addition, there are screenshots of my hobby experience working with Unreal Engine 5.
My experience working with HTML code injection (<iframe>), Python, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Android Studio can be found on the Language page.
The Resume page is a current copy of my resume and showcase the ability to implement a new printable CSS file.
