## About the Project

There are four pages showcasing my abilities to organize the work I've completed over the past 2 years: Home, About Me, Languages, and a Resume page.
The Home page represents my abilities to target and manipulate the design of HTML elements using CSS techniques; as-well-as, as well as a basic summery and navigation for my GitHub. 
The About Me page introduces a little more about myself as a Developer. In addition, there are screenshots of my hobby experience working with Unreal Engine 5.
My experience working with HTML code injection (<iframe>), Python, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Android Studio can be found on the Language page.
The Resume page is a current copy of my resume and showcases the ability to implement a new printable CSS file.
