  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Christopher Miller and I was born and raised in the Flathead Valley of Montana. I went to high-school at columbia falls high school where I was introduced to web development. Upon graduating in 2019, I served in the United States Army as a team leader for 3 years. After honorably completing my contract in 2022 I began studying Web Technology 
    As an Entry Level Web Developer:
    I'm excited to showcase the skills I've acquired through my journey learning Python, JavaScript, and HTML through the Flathead Valley Community colleges Web Technology course.
    I've gained a strong foundation in web development, starting with the fundamentals of HTML. I can confidently structure web pages, create forms, and integrate images and multimedia content in an organized manner. 
    Moving on to JavaScript, I've explored the world of dynamic web interactions. I can now manipulate the DOM, handle user input, and build interactive features like animations and user interfaces.
    Finally, Python has opened doors to data analysis and automation. I've learned to work with data structures, functions, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas to analyze and visualize data.
    This portfolio serves as a testament to my dedication to learning and my eagerness to apply these skills in real-world projects.
    Please explore my work and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
